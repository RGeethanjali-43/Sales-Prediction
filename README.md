# Sales-Prediction
Dealth with Advertising dataset and predicted the Sales, This data set includes just 3 features which is a simple data,
the features are TV, Newspaper,Radio and the target is Sales,found the type of the data set is continous.
As usual I pre processed the data, done EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis), found the distributions of the features,
and splitted test train.
Used Machine Learning packages like: 
1) Linear Regression
2) Ridge
3) Lasso
4) Random Forest
Hyper Parameter Tuning: Grid search
Find the best parameter in grid search. By using Lasso Regression algorithm the accuracy was better(89%)
compared to Linear Regression it was (88%)

Concluding the Sales prediction with Acuuracy 88% (Lasso Regression, Random Forest)
